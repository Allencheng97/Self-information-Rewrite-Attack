This repository contains the official code for **SIRA** (Self-Information Rewrite Attack), accepted at **ICML 2025**. SIRA introduces a  black-box attack that removes text watermarks from large language models (LLMs) by strategically rewriting high-entropy tokens, preserving semantics while minimizing watermark detection signals.

#### Setting up the environment

- python 3.9
- pytorch
- pip install -r requirements.txt
